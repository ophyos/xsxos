Welcome to CHTML. I know you won't read it. However, here are something we are doing:

1. A Textmate bundle

2. A industrial standard anti-gfw label and it's implementation

3. A python parser, and we will evolute it to a parser written in Chinese Programming. As you might know, it's called bootstrapping.

4. A real DTD

5. Submit it to IETF RFC and W3G

6. Search engine friendly tag system
